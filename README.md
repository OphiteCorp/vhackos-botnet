# vHack OS - Botnet
vHack OS is a mobile game. My Botnet works as a console client for windows / linux and bot at the same time.
The original idea was to create an application for command calls as well as in the game. Later, I extended it with a lot of things, including services, so it became a full-fledged bot.
For the game server, Botnet behaves like a human, so when the settings are correct, the detection is almost zero.

## The Future of Botnet
### My development on Botnet has ended and the development has taken over another division that has been developed by more people. Updates to Botnet will continue, but without my participation. Who would be interested in using Botnet, then come to the discord. Thanks.

### Notice!
Even if the odds are small, I am not responsible for any damage caused by Botnet. Like a ban on an account, etc. If you use this application, you are aware of the potential consequences and all the risks associated with it.
